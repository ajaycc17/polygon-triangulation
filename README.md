# Polygon_triangulation
Mini Project for ECS330: Digital Circuits Lab (6th Semester)

* Polygon_triangulation.ipynb:
Here I have implemented Ear-clipping triangulation algorithm which triangulates any polygon in O(n^2) time.

* Delaunay.py:
In this short code, I have used Delaunay triangulation library from scipy to triangulate a set of given vertices.

* SDL_Ear_clipping:
In this C++ code, I have used the SDL library to create a GUI for run-time triangulation of polygon. The process of installing SDL and activating it is mentioned in my blog and same is available in video here. CodeBlocks is required for it.
